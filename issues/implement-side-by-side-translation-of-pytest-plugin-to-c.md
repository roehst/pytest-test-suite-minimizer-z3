### Title: Implement side-by-side translation of pytest plugin to C

#### Objective:
Create a C implementation of the pytest plugin functionality for performance optimization.

#### Details:
- The C translation should reside under a dedicated subfolder (e.g., `c_impl`).
- Use the existing Python implementation as a reference for translating the functionality.
- Ensure the C implementation matches the logic and test suite of the Python version.

#### Deliverables:
- C files implementing the plugin functionality.
- Documentation on how to build and use the C implementation.
- Updated test suite to verify both Python and C implementations.
